Using the FingerWise service we would keep track of following services:

Main metrics:
	1.) User activity in events
		- Number of users who actually use this payment method in events. 

	2.) User payment tracking 
		- We track how much money users spend using our system compared to the regular system (credit card etc..)

	3.) User sign ups 
		- We collect data of how many people connect their credit card with the fingerprint system for the events.
		- Using this, we can get information about people who are going to use it in events afterwards.

	4.) Time between transactions
		- We measure the time between each transaction and then compare it with the regular payment methods.
		- If the time between each transaction (Finger payment system) is smaller compared to the regular card payment system then we can notify
		our customers that our system is faster and can prevent long standings in queue.
		
Metric gathering methods:
	The best way of gethering required metrics is to test it on a specified amount of people at various events. We can estimate rough numbers when
	analyzing data gathered from a smaller seed.
	For example: We can test our initial metrics with 100-200 people at an event. Let's say we take 200 people and divide them into two groups in a bar.
	One group is only going to use standard paying methods such as credit cards and cash and the other half is going to use our payment system. We can assume
	our system is going to preform better, even with smaller groups like this.
	Later, after initial indicators, we can test it out even further on a larger amount of people and optimise our system accordingly.
